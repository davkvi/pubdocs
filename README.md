# pubdocs

This is a short collection of templates and documentation i have made.
My goal for documenting a processes is the following

### Goal's!
- Sharable and easly understandable when i have forgotten what i actually did.
- EXPORTABLE! written in reasonable language like markdown
- Nice, as in the opposite of ugly.
	- Nice is better than good. good is better than ugly, ugly is better than nothing

All this might seem self explanatory, but it is only to give you a feel for what this stuff is :)
